    <p>   Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet.</p>
<p>Any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP Address, either an IPv4 address (e.g. 173.194.121.32) or an IPv6 address (e.g., 2027:0da8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337).</p>
<p>Computers can handle such addresses easily, but people have a hard time finding out who is running the server or what service the website offers. IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time.</p>
<p>To solve all those problems we use human-readable addresses called domain names.</p>
